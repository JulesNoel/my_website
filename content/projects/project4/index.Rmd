This project was realized in collaboration with my study group at London Business School. We exercised our R skills by looking at the relative ratings of the movis from two famous directors. 

A couple weeks ago, we analyzed some data on IMBD ratings. Today, we will explore if there is a clear difference in the ratings received between Tim Burton and Steven Spielberg.

**Our Null Hypothesis: The true difference in means is equal to 0.**

**Alternative hypothesis: The true difference in means is not equal to 0.**


To test this hypothesis, we will use both the `t.test` command and the `infer` package to simulate from a null distribution, where you assume zero difference between the two.

```{r load-movies-data, include = FALSE}
movies <- read_csv(here::here("data", "movies.csv"))
glimpse(movies)
```
```{r}

# Now, we want to select the date that we will use which is the rating and the directors
IMBD <- movies %>% 
  select(rating, director) %>% 
  
  # We also filtered by the two directors in question
  filter(director %in% c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg")) %>% 

  # In order to compare both directors, we group by this variable
  group_by(director) %>% 
  
  # To calculate the necessary information to run a hypothesis test we use summarise
  summarise (
         
          # General Statistics
          mean_rating = 
            mean(rating, na.rm = TRUE),
          sd_rating = 
            sd(rating, na.rm=TRUE),
          count = n(),
         
          # CI Statistics
           se_rating = 
            sd_rating/sqrt(count),
          t_critical = 
            qt(0.975, count-1), 
          margin_of_error = 
            t_critical * se_rating,
          lower = 
            mean_rating - t_critical * se_rating,
          upper = 
            mean_rating + t_critical * se_rating
            )

steve_tim <- movies %>% 
  select(rating, director) %>% 
  filter(director %in% c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg")) 

# In this line we do the ttest with the previously selected data
t.test(rating ~ director, data = steve_tim)


# In order to compare the two methods, we will run the test again using the "infer" package
obs_diff_IMBD <- steve_tim %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  calculate(
    stat = "diff in means", 
    order = c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg"))


null_dist_IMBD <- steve_tim %>%
  specify(rating ~ director) %>%
  hypothesize(null = "independence") %>%
  generate(reps = 1000, type = "permute") %>%
  calculate(
    stat = "diff in means", 
    order = c("Tim Burton", "Steven Spielberg"))


ggplot(data = null_dist_IMBD, 
       aes(
         x = stat)) +
  geom_histogram()

null_dist_IMBD %>% visualize() +
  shade_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_IMBD, direction = "two-sided")

null_dist_IMBD %>%
  get_p_value(obs_stat = obs_diff_IMBD, direction = "two_sided")

```
**Conclusion**
Following our tests, we reject the null hypothesis as the p-value is under our treshold at 95% confidence interval. We can therefore conclude that there is a clear difference between the average rating between Steven Spielberg and Tim Burton. So clearly, Steven Spielberg' movies have a higher rating than Tim Burton's.
