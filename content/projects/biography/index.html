<h2>Until now</h2>
<p>My name is Jules Noël, I am 21 years old and from Belgium. Here is my biography.</p>
<p>From my birth to my seventeenth birthday, I lived in Belgium and enjoyed simple things in life. I tried a few sports such as Basketball, Fencing on a competition level, or even rowing - <em>at least, I tried, and fell in the water more times than I actually rowed</em>. However, I stuck with scouts since my fifth birthday and later became a chief, then head chief at seventeen. This last experience is <strong>definitely</strong> the one that shaped me the most.</p>
<p>Then I embarked in a Bachelor of Economics and Business Economics at Maastricht University. This was a great time and I ultimately had the opportunity to exchange at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. <strong>It was an amazing time</strong>. If you one day visit, or return if already did, I’d like to recommend you a few things:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong> Get the best burgers at <em>Burger Barrel</em> in Coogee.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong> Visit 7-miles Beach - Great place to learn surfing. Here is a peak view:</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> Embark on a road trip. I did three, my favorite was from Sydney to Brisbane. I went with my family and got to sponsor a rescued Koala. If you wonder why they need sponsorship, here is the link to their website: <a href="https://www.koalahospital.org.au/">Koala Hospital Website</a></p>
<p>Then I went on an internship at <em>Nike</em> in the Finance department, where I practiced my financial planning skills and learned from managers on how to effectively lead a diverse team and position myself to continuously progress.</p>
<p><strong><em>Now here I am</em></strong>, starting my Masters in Financial Analysis and learning to write in R.</p>
