<p>During the third year of my Bachelor at Maastricht University, I had the opportunity to study abroad for a semester in Australia.
After long reflections, I decided to follow my courses at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.</p>
<p>My travel starts on the 13th July with my first long haul trip. Directly after my arrival, at night, I will go to Coogee Beach.</p>

This, is Coogee Beach, the beach ten minutes walk away from my apartment. This is definitely the beach I went the most to.</p>

Exert for the food addict, you need to go eat a burger at Burger Barrel on Coogee Beach. I love burgers and these ones were the best I had in my entire life.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>knitr::include_graphics(here::here(&quot;static/img/images/Australia&quot;, &quot;barrel.jpg&quot;))</code></pre>
<p><img src="C:/Users/NOEL%20Jules/Music/Data%20Analysis/Individual%20Web%20Portfolio/my_website/static/img/images/Australia/barrel.jpg" width="994" style="display: block; margin: auto;" />
Tempting right ?</p>
<p>So, apart from eating burgers and sometimes studying I travelled a lot. Notable to the Gold Coast to visit a friend that was unfortunately soon leaving Australia.
The Gold Coast, it is a bit like Miami but in Australia, judge by yourself:</p>

<p>Next stop: visiting a natural reserve with kangouroos living in freedom. However, they are accustomed to humans, we thus had the opportunity to witness these beauties closely.</p>
