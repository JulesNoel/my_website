      <description>Where Do People Drink The Most Beer, Wine And Spirits?In this project realised with my group at London Business School for the course “Data Analytics for Finance”, we will explore a dataset on the consumption and production of alcohol.
# Loading the datalibrary(fivethirtyeight)data(drinks)We’ll check first for any missing variable. Fortunately, our dataset is complete and we have no missing values.
# Using glimpse and skim to understand the dataframeglimpse(drinks)## Rows: 193## Columns: 5## $ country &amp;lt;chr&amp;gt; &amp;quot;Afghanistan&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Albania&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;Algeria&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;.</description>

      <description>Climate change and temperature anomaliesBeforehand, we downloaded a data set on weather anomalies in the past. We will make some modifications to it and analyze it.Let’s start by selecting the months from January to December and drop the “periods” variables.
tidyweather&amp;lt;- weather %&amp;gt;% select(Year,Jan:Dec) %&amp;gt;% pivot_longer(2:13, names_to=&amp;quot;month&amp;quot;, values_to = &amp;quot;delta&amp;quot;)Our tidyweather data frame has now three variables now, one each for
year,month, anddelta, or temperature deviation.</description>

      <description>Youth Risk Behavior SurveillanceWe want to explore some statistics to analyze health patterns from the CDC.Every two years, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conduct the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) survey, where it takes data from high schoolers (9th through 12th grade), to analyze health patterns.
data(yrbss)glimpse(yrbss)## Rows: 13,583## Columns: 13## $ age &amp;lt;int&amp;gt; 14, 14, 15, 15, 15, 15, 15, 14, 15, 15, 15.</description>

      <description>BiographyUntil nowMy name is Jules, I am 21 years old from Belgium and here is my biography.
From my birth to my seventeenth birthday, I lived in Belgium and enjoyed the simple things in life, tried a few sports such as Basketball, fencing on a competing level, or even rowing - at least, I tried, and fell in the water more times than I actually rowed. However, I stuck with scouts since my fifth birthday and later became a chief, then head chief at seventeen.</description>

      <description>Watching ListNowadays I don’t really have the time to watch movies. My courses at London Business School are taking most of my time and the rest of my days are dedicated to my applications to Investment Banks for a summer analyst position.
So I thought, why not already compile a list of movies to watch once the exams are behind me and my internship found.
In order to construct such list, I am going to explore the data movies used during our first assignment in Data Analytics in Finance.</description>
